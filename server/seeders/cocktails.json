Drain and discard the soaking liquid. Combine the soaked chiles with the remaining ingredients and purÃ©e until smooth.\r\n\r\nCold smoke a rack of baby back pork ribs by taking a large hotel pan with woodchips on one side and charcoal on the other. Place another, smaller, pan with pork ribs, above the charcoal/woodchip pan. Ignite the charcoal, being careful to not ignite the woodchips. Cover both pans with foil and allow to smoke for 10-15 minutes, until desired level of smoke is achieved, then coat with adobo marinade and wrap in tin foil prior to placing ribs in a 300 degree oven for 7 hours. When the ribs have cooled, strain off the fat and use for the infusion.\r\n\r\nIf youâre having a hard time coming up to the same kind of volume of fat, make up the balance with pork lard from a butcher. To get the same depth of flavor without the ribs, heat up the fat in a pot with a few spoons of the marinade.\r\n\r\nOnce youâve got your tub of seasoned pork fat in cooled liquid form, pour equal amounts of Ilegal Joven mezcal and fat into a sealable container. Seal the container and give it a really good shake, then put it in the freezer overnight. When the whole thing is separated and congealed, pour it through a fine mesh chinoise. If you donât have a chinoise, try a fine mesh strainer, or if you donât have one of those, try spooning off most of the fat. There will be some beads of orange fat left in the strained mezcal: run that through a few layers of cheesecloth (or coffee filters in a pinch) to get rid of the last of it.\r\n\r\nThe mezcal is now ready for drinking, straight-up or in a cocktail. \r\n\r\nHabanero tincture\r\n\r\nSlice habaneros and add 2 ounces Ilegal Joven mezcal.\r\nAllow to sit overnight or until desired level of heat is achieved.\r\nCocktail\r\n\r\nCombine mezcal and chocolate liqueur in a mixing glass with ice and stir for 45 seconds.\r\nStrain into chilled coupe.\r\nCarefully \"sink\" the coffee liqueur down the inside of the coupe over a spoon.\r\nGarnish with 5 drops habanero tincture.","image":"https://www.thecocktaildb.com/images/media/drink/osgvxt1513595509.jpg","ingredients":["Mezcal","Chocolate liqueur","Coffee liqueur"],"measure":["2 oz","3/4 oz","1/2 oz"]},{"name":"Orgasm","glass":"Cocktail glass","instructions":"Shake all ingredients with ice, strain into a chilled cocktail glass, and serve.","image":"https://www.thecocktaildb.com/images/media/drink/vr6kle1504886114.jpg","ingredients":["Creme de Cacao","Amaretto","Triple sec","Vodka","Light cream"],"measure":["1/2 oz white ","1/2 oz ","1/2 oz ","1/2 oz ","1 oz "]},{"name":"Old Pal","glass":"Nick and Nora Glass","instructions":"Chill cocktail glass.
